# 🎓 HowPhySIX.h 

Welcome to the **Special Practice** section of the `HowPhySIX.h` project — a physics simulation toolkit designed especially for **HSC 1st Paper** students. This folder (`splprac/`) contains various Java-based simulations created using **Swing GUI**, allowing students and educators to visualize and interact with physics concepts in real-time.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

The `splprac/` folder focuses on important mechanics topics that are core to the HSC syllabus. These include motion, force, momentum, collisions, and more.

### ✅ Simulations Included

| File Name                  | Description                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CollisionSimulation.java`| Simulates momentum conservation and elastic/inelastic collisions between two objects. |
| `FreeFall.java`           | Visualizes objects falling under gravity with variable height. |
| `ProjectileMotion.java`   | Demonstrates 2D projectile motion with velocity and angle controls. |
| `NewtonSecondLaw.java`    | Shows how force, mass, and acceleration are related dynamically. |
| `FrictionOnIncline.java`  | Interactive model to visualize friction on an inclined plane. |
| `VerticalThrow.java`      | Visualizes upward motion and free fall with time-based graphs. |

## 📘 Educational Goals

These simulations are meant to:

- Help students understand **core physics principles** visually.
- Provide **interactive tools** for **self-study** and **classroom demonstration**.
- Bridge the gap between **theory** and **practical understanding**.

Ideal for:
- HSC students (Bangladesh curriculum or similar)
- College freshmen learning classical mechanics
- Physics clubs, tutors, or self-learners

## ⚙️ How to Use

### ✅ Requirements

- Java 8 or above  
- Any IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

### ▶️ Running a Simulation

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sakinadi21/-HowPhySIX.h-.git
Open the project in your Java IDE.

Navigate to:
src/splprac/

Choose a file, for example:

CollisionSimulation.java

FreeFall.java

Right-click → Run as Java Application.

That’s it! You’ll see a visual simulation window with controls.


## 🧰 Technologies Used
Java

Swing (GUI Toolkit)
