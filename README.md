ðŸ“˜ HowPhySIX.h
This folder contains specially crafted physics simulations designed for HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) 1st Paper students. Built with Java Swing, these simulations provide a hands-on and interactive way to visualize and understand key physics concepts.
```
```
ðŸ”¬ Covered Topics

Newton's Laws of Motion

Momentum and Collisions


Free Fall and Gravity

Kinematic Equations Visualization

Friction and Inclined Planes
```
```
ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Language: Java

GUI Framework: Swing

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (recommended)

Platform: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)
```
```
ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sakinadi21/-HowPhySIX.h-.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

Navigate to the src/splprac directory.

Run the desired .java file (e.g. CollisionSimulation.java) as a Java Application.
```
```
ðŸŽ¯ Educational Purpose
This module is designed to help:

HSC students learn physics interactively.

Teachers/tutors demonstrate real-time simulations.

Self-learners get a visual grasp of motion, force, and energy.
