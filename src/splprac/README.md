# ⚛️ How-PhySIx.h – Java Swing Physics Simulator 

**How-PhySIx.h** is a Java-based project using **Swing GUI** to visualize and simulate core concepts from Physics. Designed as an educational tool, it helps students understand physical laws through interactive simulations, not just equations.

## 🧪 Topics Covered

✅ Motion and Kinematics  
✅ Newton's Laws  
✅ Force, Mass, and Acceleration  
✅ Free Fall and Projectile Motion  
✅ Work, Energy, and Power  
✅ Ideal Gas 

> Inspired by textbook problems and real-life classroom confusion 😄

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open the project in your Java IDE  
3. Run `Main.java`  
4. Use the interface to select a simulation and enter values (e.g., initial velocity, time)  
5. See results in graphical or textual form

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

Developed to help HSC students:
- Visualize physics formulas in action  
- Eliminate fear of complex concepts  
- Learn through interaction and experimentation

> This project was built as part of my academic passion project at NSTU.
